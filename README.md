ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project aims to create a professional and interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing Superstore Sales data. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Superstore Sales Dataset

Number of Records: 9,800

Columns: 18

Key Fields:

Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date

Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment

Region, State, City, Postal Code

Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name

Sales, Profit, Ship Mode

ðŸ”¹ Project Objectives

Analyze total sales, orders, and customer behavior.

Identify top-selling products, regions, and customer segments.

Track sales trends over time (yearly, monthly, daily).

Evaluate shipping efficiency and delivery delays.

Provide interactive filters and drill-down insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Sales = SUM(Superstore[Sales])

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Superstore[Order ID])

Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Superstore[Customer ID])

Average Order Value (AOV) = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])

Sales by Region, State, and City

Top 10 Customers & Products by Sales

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

Sales Growth % (YoY)

Late Shipments % = Percentage of delayed deliveries
